G is the group S6 as follows
Symmetric group G acting on a set of cardinality 6
Order = 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5
    (1, 2)(3, 4)(5, 6)
    (1, 2)
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
G has order
720
we have a group S5, check it is S5b by checking
that the restriction to A5 is absolutely irreducible
60
true
check the order 6 element (***)(**) has char poly (x-1)^2(x^2+x+1)
[
    <x + 1, 2>,
    <x^2 + x + 1, 1>
]
