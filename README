%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
GSpF3
*****************************************
checks that if g in 2C,2D,6G,6H,6I,
then g^4-1 is zero iff g has order 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
allcurvesF2
*****************************************
computation of all curves over F2 of
genus 2, which in particular collates all
the good ordinary curves.
It also computes the number of curves
with the same characterstic polynomial
as the conjugacy classes of types
{2C,6G,6H}, {2D,6I}, 8A, 10A.
Optional (commented out), prints out full
list of ordinary curves.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
curvesoverF16
*****************************************
computes the 48 ambiguous curves of
possible type 2C/6G/6H and 2D/6I over F2
now over F16 to verify that the 3-torsion
is always (Z/3Z)^2 thus showng that 2C,2D
do not occur. Optional (commented out),
prints out full list of ambiguous curves
6G/6H for future processing.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
curvesoverF3
*****************************************
computes the curves over F3, and counts
how many times each of the 40 possible
conjugacy classes occur (only 36 occur at
least once). Checks the 141 curves for
which Frobenius is x^2*(1+x)^2. checks
that only 5 have Jac(X)=Z/3Z x Z/3Z and
these are not 3-distinguished in char=0.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
curves6H6G
*****************************************
list of curves with good reduction at 2
such that rhobar_3(\Frob_2) is either of
type 6G or 6H, computed by allcurvesF2.
Broken into two sets of ordinary and 
non-ordinary curves each of size 24. 
The forms have been chosen to have a non-
zero coefficient of z^6 for the division
algorithm to work. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
distinguished
*****************************************
Finds the X with Jac(X)(F_3)[3]= (Z/3Z)^2
and confirms there are exactly 5 of them,
and Q(X) = P(X)^2 in those cases.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
decide6H
*****************************************
use division polynomials to compute the
degree 40 map Gal(K/Q)-->PGSp_4(F_3)-->S_40
then compute resolventsto get
Gal(K/Q)-->S_27, then work out conjugacy
class of Frob_2 from curves6H6G data.
This is very slow, sorry.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
divisionpolynomials.m
*****************************************
Given
y^2=x^6+a*x^4+b*x^3+c*x^2+d*x+e;
compute the degree 40 permutation
representation of Gal(K/Q)
(via PGSp_4(F_3)-->S_40)).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
AllBig.tex
*****************************************
File from LMFDB with all X such that Jac(X)
has good reduction at 2 and 3 and surjective
mod-3 torsion rep.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
allstats
*****************************************
Checks which curves in AllBig.tex satisfy
the main theorem.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
permutationreps
*****************************************
action of GSp on 80 and 27 points; noting
that if the action on 40 and 27 points is
transitive the image is surjective.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Qexamples
*****************************************
The 3 examples in the paper with WP over Q
and the three Euler factors at 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Weierstrassdivision.m
*****************************************
the degree 40 and 27 polynomials associated
to y^2 = quintic
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
RegularSemisimple
*****************************************
Generates the Whitmore table with the
regular semisimple element condition
as well.
